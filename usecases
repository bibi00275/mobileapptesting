Performance Under Strain

Network Conditions: Simulate various network conditions (poor 3G, fluctuating Wi-Fi, interruptions) to understand how your app behaves under less than ideal scenarios. Network related issues are a major user pain point on mobile devices.
Battery Usage: Monitor how your app impacts battery life. Excessive drain will lead to poor user experience and uninstallations. Profiling tools are your friend here.
Resource Consumption: Ensure your app doesn't overuse memory or CPU, leading to sluggish performance or crashes on devices with varying hardware capabilities.
Device & OS Fragmentation

Screen Sizes & Resolutions: Test on a range of devices to guarantee your UI adapts correctly. This includes orientations (portrait vs. landscape).
OS Versions: Android and iOS have varying degrees of fragmentation. Ensure your app functions as expected on the most popular OS versions, including recent minor updates.
Device Specific Quirks (Optional): If resources permit, consider testing on a few devices known for unique behaviors (camera quirks, custom manufacturer overlays on Android, etc.).
Usability on Mobile

Touch Interactions: Verify that touch targets are sufficiently sized, gestures work intuitively, and scrolling is smooth.
Interruptions: Test how your app recovers from scenarios like incoming phone calls, switching between apps, or going in and out of airplane mode. Data and session state preservation are key.
Offline Capabilities: Can parts of your app function offline (if applicable)? Ensure graceful handling and data synchronization when the network returns.
Platform-Specific Nuances

Permissions: Understand how your app interacts with Android and iOS permission models (location, camera, storage). Test the experience when a user denies critical permissions.
Background Behavior: Ensure your app behaves as expected with iOS and Android rules around running in the background (data updates, notifications).
Deep Linking: If your app integrates with other apps via deep links, thoroughly test these on both platforms.
Testing Tools & Strategies

Emulators/Simulators and Real Devices: A mix of both is essential. Cloud device providers can help access a broader range of real devices.
Appium: Popular framework for cross-platform automated mobile testing if that aligns with your strategy.
Network Throttling Tools: Purposefully restrict bandwidth to simulate real-world conditions.
Instrumentation: Use profiling tools to measure CPU, memory, and battery consumption during app use.
